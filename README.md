# Build your first Recommendation Engine with Python
These simple Jupyter Notebook will help you build a recommendation system that suggest a user a list of recommended movies based on other users' visualizations.
The approach is a collaborative filtering recommendation engine, where each user/movie interacion is compared to all the others user/movie interactions. 
A certain movie is recommended to a certain user only if it has been high-ranked by users with similar movies preferences.
