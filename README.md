# Build your first Recommendation Engine with Python

This code will help you build a recommendation system using different algorithms. The case study relies on a movie review database. The aim is to suggest new movies to each user in agreement with its taste.

The following algorith will be implemented and explained:
1. Knowledge Based Recommendation
2. Collaborative Filtering Reccomendation
3. Content Based Recommendation
4. FunkSVD Algorithm

Possible evaluation metrics and how to deal with the Cold Start problem will be also discussed.
# Installation

## Download 
Enter the folder you like, open a terminal here and clone my GitHub repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/matteobonanomi/dsnd_movie_recommend.git
```

## Use Jupyter Notebooks
Open the folder **notebooks** inside the cloned repo. The content is divided in several notebooks.
My suggestion is to run them in the correct order:

1. Introduction to the Recommendation Data
2. Most Popular Recommendations
3. Measuring Similarity
4. Collaborative Filtering
5. Content Based Recommendations
6. Intro to SVD
7. Implementing FunkSVD
8. How Are We Doing
9. Cold Start Problem
